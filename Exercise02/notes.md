# Exercise 2

## b

If we know the full distribution rather than only the estimate itself, we can reduce the model complexity with a minimum loss in accurracy by dropping the variables corresponding to the coefficients with highest variance. This is due to the fact that the maximum likelihood estimate is computed over the dataset, however our coefficients should minimize the loss of the model over the true underlying data-generating distribution.
